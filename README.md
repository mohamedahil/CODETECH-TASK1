Overview of the Project

Project:TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY MONITORING WITH (DHT) SENSOR.(TASK-1).

Objective:
The objective of the Temperature and Humidity Monitoring System with a DHT Sensor is to continuously monitor environmental conditions, 
specifically temperature and humidity, using a DHT sensor. The system aims to provide real-time data and display it locally or remotely,
with potential for alerts and data logging. This project is useful for various applications, such as smart homes, greenhouses, weather stations, 
server rooms, and industrial monitoring systems.

Key Features:
Real-time Monitoring:

Continuously measure and display temperature and humidity levels.
Provide immediate feedback on environmental conditions.
Accurate Data Collection:

Use the DHT sensor (DHT11/DHT22) for precise temperature and humidity measurements.
Measure temperature in degrees Celsius (or Fahrenheit) and humidity in percentage.
Simple User Interface:

Display readings on an LCD/OLED screen or through a serial monitor.
Option for web or mobile interface for remote monitoring (with Wi-Fi-enabled microcontroller).
Alert System (Optional):

Trigger an alert (buzzer, LED, or notifications) when temperature or humidity exceeds predefined thresholds.
Useful for critical applications like server rooms, storage facilities, or greenhouses.
Data Logging:

Option to log temperature and humidity readings over time.
Save data to an SD card or cloud storage for long-term analysis and reporting.
